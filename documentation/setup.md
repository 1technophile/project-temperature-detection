# How to setup your environment

## Setup you environment with Arduino IDE (the easiest if you don't know PlatformIO)

* First download the last version of the Arduino IDE from the arduino [website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* Download temperature_detection code from the [project page](https://github.com/helpfulengineering/project-temperature-detection) and unzip it
* Add to your IDE environment the Adafruit MLX90614 Library version 1.0.1:
* `Sketch`->`Include Library`-> `Manage Libraries`
* Search for Adafruit MLX90614
* Install the version 1.0.1
* Open the file `temperature-detection.ino` from `temperature-detection` folder

## Setup you environment with PlatformIO (the best if you want to contribute)

* First download the last version of the Visual Studio Code VSC  [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Add the PIO extension [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
* Download temperature_detection code from the [project page](https://github.com/helpfulengineering/project-temperature-detection) and unzip it
* Open the folder `temperature_detection_project` with VSC
